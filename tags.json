Eusocial weapons can be used to Skirmish or Barrage by adjacent allies as if they had them installed. The owner spends charges and takes heat generated by the system or weapon as normal, while the user provides its own talents, traits, core bonuses and other modifiers for the instance of use.</div><div>If an action or reaction granted by an Eusocial system or weapon has a use limitation, it is shared between all characters. For example, if a character activates an Eusocial system with a limitation of 1/round, that system cannot be activated (either by its owner or through Eusocial), until the start of that character's next turn.</div>"
